# uBlock filters by hant0508

This filter list for uBlock Origin/Adblock Plus is designed to be used with such lists as EasyList, RU AdList etc., so it's
substantially free of intersections with them. The list is made for blocking ad (mostly on Russian websites) missed 
by other filter lists maintainers. It is regularly updated and actively developed for now.

**Filter list installation:**
click **[subscribe](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hant0508/uBlock-fillters/master/filters.txt&title=Filters%20by%20hant0508)** or use direct link:<br>

### Recommendations
This filter list is compatible with most modern ad blockers, however it's recommended to use
[uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) to supporting all the features — it's more lightweight and functional compared to
Adblock.

**uBlock Origin installation**: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/ublock/), [advanced installation options](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation)

I recommend using the following filter lists for the best result:
* [EasyList](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=easylist.github.io/easylist/easylist.txt&title=EasyList)
* [EasyPrivacy](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=easylist.github.io/easylist/easyprivacy.txt&title=EasyPrivacy)
* [Adblock Warning Removal List](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/antiadblockfilters.txt&title=Adblock%20Warning%20Removal%20List)
* [RU AdList](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/advblock.txt&title=RU%20AdList)
* [Peter Lowe’s Ad server list](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=&title=)*
* [Adguard Russian Filter](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://adguard.com/en/filter-rules.html?id=1&title=Adguard%20Russian%20Filter)*
* [uBlock Filters +](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IDKwhattoputhere/uBlock-Filters-Plus/master/uBlock-Filters-Plus.txt&title=uBlock%20Filters%20%2B)* <br>
*only compatible with uBlock Origin

I also recommend to see **[userscripts](https://github.com/hant0508/usescripts)** and **[userstyles](https://github.com/hant0508/userstyles)** repositories. There you can find scripts and styles removing "complicated" ads.

### Feedback

difficulties in blocking ads on any site, you can also
